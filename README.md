# Tipsy Scoop Club - a Sequelize/Express Review
### (by Sarah and Maria)


### Start it up

* `$ createdb tipsyscoopclub` (first time setup only; assumes you have PostgreSQL and its CLI tool installed)
* `$ npm install`
* `$ npm start`

### Check out those routes!

* You'll need to use the post route a few times or just add info directly in Postico because there is no seed file. But you're here to learn about routes anyway, so I don't feel bad about making you do that.
* I highly recommend downloading the Postman tool for testing routes
    * You can use Postman to send all types of requests to your localhost and see the responses

### There's a review video featuring this repo coming up

### Add-A-Scoop Challenge: try adding your own method and route!
* Increment the number of total scoops an eater has by creating a method and a route that uses it
* You can see a solution to this in the `scoop-solution` branch (also upcoming)
* Play around and see what other methods and routes you can come up with!

### That's it! Happy Studying!
