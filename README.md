# üç¶ Tipsy Scoop Club - a Sequelize/Express Review üç¶
### (by Sarah and Maria!)


### Start it up

* `$ createdb tipsyscoopclub` (first time setup only; assumes you have PostgreSQL and its CLI tool installed)
* `$ npm install`
* `$ npm start`

### Check out those routes!

* You'll need to use the post route a few times or just add info directly in Postico because there is no seed file.
* Downloading the Postman tool for testing routes is highly recommended
* You can use Postman to send all types of requests to your localhost and see the responses

### Add-A-Scoop Challenge: try adding your own method and route!

* Increment the number of total scoops an eater has by creating a method and a route that uses it
* You can see a solution to this in the `scoop-solution` branch (Sunday)

### Average-Scoops Challenge: find an eaters average scoops per day

* Make a Sequelize instance method to return the average scoops per day for an eater
* You can see a solution to this in the `avg-scoop-solution` branch (Sunday)

### Light-Flavors Challenge: find all flavors under a certain calorie

* Make a method and route to return an array of all flavors below a passed in amount of calories
* You can see a solution to this in the `light-flavors-solution` branch (Sunday)

### Update-Icecream Challenge: update an ice cream flavor

* Write a route to update an already existing ice cream entry
* You can see a solution to this in the `update-ice-solution` branch (Sunday)

#### Play around and see what other methods and routes you can come up with!

### That's it! Happy Studying!
